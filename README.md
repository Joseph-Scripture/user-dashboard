# Project: Admin Dashboard
- This project is a complete admin dashboard layout built from scratch as part of The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS curriculum. The primary focus was on mastering advanced layout techniques, specifically CSS Grid, to create a complex and responsive interface.

## Description
This project challenged me to build a complex, multi-column dashboard page without a detailed design file, relying on a single reference image. The layout features a sidebar for navigation and a main content area with project cards, announcements, and trending sections. The entire structure is built using CSS Grid, demonstrating its power for creating robust two-dimensional layouts.

## Key Features
- Complex Grid Layout: The entire page structure, including the sidebar and main content area with its nested grids, is managed by CSS Grid.

- Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be functional and visually appealing across different screen sizes.

- SVG Icons: Icons are implemented using inline SVG or as background images to keep the project lightweight and scalable.

- Semantic HTML: The structure uses modern HTML5 tags like <main>, <nav>, <section>, and <article> for better accessibility and SEO.

- Interactive Elements: Hover states are used on buttons, links, and project cards to provide visual feedback to the user.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: For the semantic structure of the dashboard.

- CSS3: For all styling, layout, and responsiveness.

- CSS Grid: The core technology used for the main page layout and nested content areas.

- Flexbox: Used for smaller component alignment within grid items (e.g., aligning icons with text).

- Custom Properties: For maintainable and consistent theming (colors, fonts, etc.).

### Learning Outcomes
- This project was a significant step in my learning journey. Key takeaways include:

- Mastery of CSS Grid: I gained a deep understanding of grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-area, and how to create complex, nested grids.

- Layout Planning: I learned how to deconstruct a complex layout from a reference image and plan the HTML structure accordingly.

- Combining Grid and Flexbox: I now understand when to use Grid for the overall structure and Flexbox for fine-tuning the alignment of content within that structure.

- Attention to Detail: Replicating the design required a keen eye for spacing, alignment, and typography.
